In February 2022, EPA attended the NexGen FOIA Tech Showcase to get gain knowledge of new FOIA technologies to assist the agency with its FOIA mission. In July 2022, EPA posted a request for information and in October 2022, EPA posted its request for quotes for a FOIA case management system to replace FOIAonline. On March 8, 2023, EPA selected the winning quote for a FOIA case management system to replace FOIAonline and entered into a contract with OPEXUS to provide FOIAXpress. Throughout the remainder of FY2023 and into FY2024, EPA has worked with OPEXUS to use FOIAXpress to its fullest and to identify ways that the FOIAXpress system can be improved to better meet FOIA implementation demands. In January 2023, EPA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National FOIA Office attended a demonstration of an AI- powered software to automate the redaction of sensitive information within audio, video, and image-based evidence and Veritone, which allows for the transcription and translation of audio and video files.\"\n\n2. \"On March 8, 2023, EPA entered a contract with OPEXUS (formerly AINS) to provide EPA and FOIA requesters with the new FOIA case management software solution to replace FOIAonline, which was decommissioned on September 30, 2023.
